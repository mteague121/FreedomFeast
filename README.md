# FreedomFeast
Final project for SummitWorks, made with two other colleagues.

This project includes some features showcasing the teams abilities. We were assigned a huge list of tasks and given five days to complete the project, so some parts of the code are weak.

Personally, I worked on most of the frontend (Angular folder) and some of the work on the backend server (the other folder). 

The original project went live on AWS's EC2 instance for the backend, AWS's S3 Buckets for the frontend, and Microsofts's MySQL platform (I had no part in the database side).

Some features included were signup/login authentication, menu and kitchen creation, a cart for logged in customers to add items to, and an email service which would email you about your account being created and whenever you would click the purchase button.
